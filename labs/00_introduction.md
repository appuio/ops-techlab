OpenShift Operations Techlab

In the following guided and hands-on techlab we show the participants how to operate [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/).

The lab covers automated installation and upgrades of OpenShift, troubleshooting and maintenance procedures as well as backup and restore of cluster configuration and resources.
