OpenShift Operations Techlab

In the following guided and hands-on techlab we show the participants how to operate [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/).
If you did not already see the slides please have a look at them under: [Slides](https://appuio.github.io/ops-techlab/#/)

The lab covers automated installation and upgrades of OpenShift, troubleshooting and maintenance procedures as well as backup and restore of cluster configuration and resources.
