## Lab 1.2: How to Access the Lab Environment

In the following labs, we are going to use `user[X]` as a placeholder for the user id that was assigned to you.

If you e.g. had user id 1 you would change
```
https://console.user[X].lab.openshift.ch
```
to
```
https://console.user1.lab.openshift.ch
```


There are three main ways we will access our environment. The mentioned ports need to be open from our own location to Amazon AWS.

- **API** / **Console**
  - Address: https://console.user[X].lab.openshift.ch
  - Port: 443/tcp

- **Applications**
  - Address: https://console.user[X].lab.openshift.ch
  - Ports: 80/tcp and 443/tcp

- **Administration**
  - Address: jump.lab.openshift.ch
  - User: ec2-user
  - Port: 22/tcp
  - Command:
```
ssh ec2-user@jump.lab.openshift.ch
ssh ec2-user@master0.user[X].lab.openshift.ch
```
