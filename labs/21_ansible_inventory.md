## Lab 2.1: Create the Ansible Inventory

In this lab, we will verify the Ansible inventory file, so it fits our lab cluster. The Inventory file describes, how the cluster will be built.

Take a look at the prepared inventory file:
```
[ec2-user@master0 ~]$ less /etc/ansible/hosts
```

Download the default example hosts file from the OpenShift GitHub repository and compare it to the prepared inventory for the lab.
```
[ec2-user@master0 ~]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/release-3.6/inventory/byo/hosts.ose.example
[ec2-user@master0 ~]$ vimdiff hosts.ose.example /etc/ansible/hosts
```
